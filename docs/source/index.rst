Mailiness
=====================================

**Mailiness** provides you with a CLI to easily manage your mail server.

Installation
------------

Install the app using *pip*:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install mailiness

Now type ``mailiness -h`` to get an overview of the commands available.

To get help on a specific command, simply type ``mailiness command -h``.
For example:

.. code-block:: console

   mailiness dkim -h

The CLI is organized by commands and subcommands. For example, to generate a DKIM key, you
use the *keygen* subcommand available via the *dkim* command as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   mailiness dkim keygen example.com

To view help for subcommands, simply add *-h* at the end.
